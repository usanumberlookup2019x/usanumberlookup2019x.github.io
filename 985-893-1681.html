How does the Microsoft model "crush" humans?

To better test the generalizability of existing models, CoQA collects data from seven different fields: children's stories, literature, middle and high school English tests, news, wikipedia, Reddit and science. The first five types of articles are used for model training, development, and test sets, and the last two are only used for test sets.

CoQA USES F1 (a statistical measure of the accuracy of binary models) indicators to assess performance. F1 scoring measures the average word overlap between the actual q&a performance of the model system and the predicted situation. F1 in the domain is graded according to the test data of the same domain as the training set. And scoring the test data from different domains outside F1. Overall F1 is the final score for the entire test set.

The Microsoft researchers used a strategy of training the model system to learn from several related tasks and use the information to improve the target machine reading comprehension (MRC) task.



In this multi-stage and multi-task fine-tuning method, researchers first learn MRC related background information from related tasks under the multi-task setting, then fine-tune the model on the target task, and use language modeling to assist the completion of tasks in the two stages, to help reduce the over-fitting of conversational q&a model.

The NLP and SDRG strategies worked, and their machine models' strong performance in the CoQA challenge is further evidence of this.



After half a century, mankind has achieved ten milestones in the field of NLP

NLP is an important sub-field in the field of artificial intelligence, and it is also a very attractive human-computer interaction mode. Since the research of machine translation and artificial intelligence in the 1950s, NLP has a history of as long as half a century.

Over the past two decades, scientists have used statistical machine learning to push NLP technology forward.

In the past four years, deep learning has brought a new learning model to NLP. Among them, the tasks of single-sentence translation, extractive reading comprehension and grammar checking have reached the level comparable to human beings.
