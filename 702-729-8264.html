By 2023, China will have an estimated 354 million PC gamers playing online games, more than the entire population of the United States. The sheer number of players will generate an estimated $16 billion for China's massive gaming industry in the same year. Remember, the mobile game market is bigger than the PC market in China.



The data comes from the 2019 China PC online game market research report released by Niko Partners, an Asian game market research and consulting firm. The report not only summarizes China's PC games in 2019, but also forecasts the country's gaming industry by 2023.

China's PC gaming market has exploded since 2001. According to Lisa Cosmas Hanson, founder of Niko Partners, PC Gamer reported that China's PC gaming market at the time was only worth $100 million.


Surprisingly, China's PC gaming market continues to rebound despite strict government controls. In March 2018, the Chinese government temporarily froze the license Numbers that all new games must be issued and operated in the country. The ban, which lasted nearly a full year, led Niko Partners to cut their initial forecast for the Chinese gaming market in 2018. Despite the license plate freeze, China's PC gaming industry as a whole reached $15.21 billion in 2018. The total number of PC players reached 312.4 million, of which 79.7 million spent money on games.

By comparison, the entire U.S. domestic gaming industry, including PCS, mobile phones and consoles, generated $30.4 billion in revenue in 2018 (according to Newzoo).

The Niko Partners report also includes Steam's projected revenue. Steam is an increasingly important part of the PC game market in China, and over the past few years Steam has successfully taken root in China, while other services like Twitch have been blocked or modified due to government censorship. Through Steam, Chinese players can play games that will never be approved for sale, such as GTA5.

More than 24 percent of Steam users currently use simplified Chinese as their language, and China is already the largest source of Steam downloads. Earlier this year, survival said Asia accounted for more than half (53%) of its $920 million in revenue.

As a result, China's PC gaming industry is huge, growing steadily despite being overtaken by mobile games and slowed by regulatory changes, according to the report.
