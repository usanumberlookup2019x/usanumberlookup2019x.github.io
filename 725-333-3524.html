The biggest winner in the 5G era may be China's huawei. It now holds more than 15 percent of the world's 5G patents, compared with nearly 14 percent for Finland's nokia. On top of that, South Korea's samsung has less than 13 percent and its main rival LG has more than 12 percent. Qualcomm, a top American firm, applied for just over 8% of key patents, about the same as Sweden's Ericsson and trailing China's zte with 11.7%. In addition, Intel holds more than 5 percent of the market, with the rest split between Chinese and Japanese startups.

Do not look down upon the status of patents, new patent licensing is of inestimable value. The move comes just days after qualcomm said it would receive compensation from apple for a legal dispute -- equivalent to about two years' worth of 4G royalties -- worth between $4.5bn and $4.7bn. Qualcomm's share of 5G patent applications is only slightly below its 4G patent holding rate, so its annual revenue from 5G patent licensing should easily reach billions of dollars.

Assuming the final percentage of patents held is similar to the percentage filed, the 5G pioneers that provide the specific base-station or commercial chip involved will reap significant patent revenue. For Chinese companies, it should make up some of the lost sales in foreign markets (such as huawei and zte). Patent fees also provide a guaranteed source of income for all innovators to subsidize their respective operators and consumers to promote faster popularization and development of 5G.
