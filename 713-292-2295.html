The biggest obstacle of sharing economy is "people". Now, the pace of global ride-hailing giants going public is causing more frustration among platform drivers, and a broader shutdown awaits Uber and Lyft.

Although driverless technology may be the best way for ride-hailing companies to make profits in the future, drivers are still the most important part of the profit chain for ride-hailing companies. How will the explosion of their dissatisfaction with the status quo challenge the ride-hailing model? As drivers become increasingly dissatisfied and users complain, why is the value chain of the ride-sharing economy becoming more vulnerable?

A growing number of drivers have joined the strike to demand higher wages

Uber and Lyft drivers in about eight us cities are planning to stop offering ride-hailing services on May 8 to demand better wages and working conditions, Reuters and other foreign media reported. About 4,200 ride-hailing drivers in Los Angeles will jointly stop taking orders from Uber and Lyft, according to the head of the New York taxi association (NYTWA).

Drivers in San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, Philadelphia and Washington, d.c. The New York taxi union says drivers are demanding job security, a steady income and a cap on what ride-hailing companies can charge from fares.

Although Uber plans an initial public offering next month that could see some of the platform's drivers owning "assets," the rewards won't be "affordable" for more drivers, whose gains so far have been modest. "We provide the most basic services, but Uber and Lyft executives and investors are the ones who benefit," a Lyft driver who frequently picks up orders at Los Angeles airports said in a public statement.
