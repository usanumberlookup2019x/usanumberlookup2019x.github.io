Europe and America are leading the way in developing flying cars

The leading companies in the development of flying cars are European and American companies. Europe's airbus, Germany's audi and Italy's Italdesign are pushing ahead with plans for flying cars known as "Pop Up Next". Companies representing Europe in aircraft and cars have joined forces.

Flying cars are being developed to combine autonomous all-electric vehicles (evs) with passenger drones. Urban areas are driven by pure electric cars, while the movement between cities is carried in the air by a drone with a cabin. The developer showed off a quarter-size prototype in November 2018. It will be put into use as a flying taxi within 10 years.

In addition, the United States Boeing will also actively promote the development of flying cars. In 2017, Boeing added AuroraFlightSciences, a startup developing drones, to its subsidiary.

If the market for flying cars takes shape, it will also help create new parts industries. "Planes and cars are moving closer together," said Greg Hyslop, Boeing's chief technology officer. Self-driving technology and electrification are indispensable for the realization of flying cars. The development of core technologies for automobiles and flying vehicles overlaps with each other and is expected to expand the demand for sensor components, batteries and lightweight materials.

Among Japanese companies, SUBARU, which has helicopter and aircraft operations, and kawasaki heavy are in the early stages of launching feasibility assessments for flying cars. "In the field of vehicles that transport people and things, the affinity between cars and planes is very high," said masichiro tozuka, subaru's executive director. Subaru is getting into both.
