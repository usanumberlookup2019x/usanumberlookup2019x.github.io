For several years, India has been quietly trying to move towards indigenous chip design, despite its initial problems, because it sees local chip development as a strategic necessity.

Several attempts have been made to build a semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem, including talks with leading chipmakers AMD and TSMC to build a domestic fabs in line with global thinking. Countries recognise that local chip development helps protect their strategic interests.

China, for example, is implementing a domestic chip programme that aims to use 70 per cent of its products in semiconductors by 2025, up from 16 per cent now.

For its part, India is seeking to create a home-grown fab semiconductor design ecosystem and use local talent to help nurture academic institutions and start-ups.

The idea is to move away from relying solely on microprocessors from global technology companies such as Intel, AMD and ARM, and chips from qualcomm, samsung and mediatek for mobile phones, to a parallel path.

Over the past two decades, a number of global semiconductor companies, including ARM, qualcomm, Intel, Cadence and Texas instruments, have built design and software development infrastructure here, helping develop a critical pool of people who understand chip development.

The government hopes to use these talents to help entrepreneurs with chip design and the fabless semiconductor ecosystem.
