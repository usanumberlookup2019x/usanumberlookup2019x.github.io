Some time ago, the world's first photograph of a black hole was released. The friend circle refresh one, some people make fun of that year the mankind moon landing also so, also some people sigh with emotion the universe is wonderful. This is an achievement that human beings have gone through hundreds of years and countless scientific workers have strived for a lifetime. We are always on the way to the exploration of science and technology.

Technology is taking us all the way to the galaxy, which may be a long way from the lives of ordinary people, but the applications of consumer technologies that have transformed our daily needs and production in the last decade have drawn a profound line between our lives and those of thousands of years ago.

Not to mention the fact that human beings thousands of years ago traveled to the present day, and they will worship the various instant communication technologies and the readily available services of the present day. That is to say, people in the 1980s and 1990s will travel to the present cashless society and the ubiquitous O2O instant services, and they will be dumbfounded.

The consumer technology upgrades that have profoundly changed our lives have not stopped, and they are deepening and expanding rapidly, driven by booming demand.
