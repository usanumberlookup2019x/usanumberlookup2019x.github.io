That's more than double the share of 4G patents held by Chinese companies. By contrast, us tech giants including qualcomm and Intel hold only 14 per cent of key 5G patents.

As of April, huawei has 1,554 patents, ahead of nokia (1427), samsung (1316) and other companies, is the company with the largest number of necessary patents for 5G standards. As for huawei's leading position, the Wall Street journal once commented that "huawei's influence in 5G is not comparable to that of Chinese companies in the era of previous generations of wireless networks".

Moreover, standard essential patents, as the name suggests, are irreplaceable or technically unavoidable. As a result, while Chinese companies have an edge in 5G technology patents, global telecommunications companies will have to pay them royalties when 5G networks are rolled out.
