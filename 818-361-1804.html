For manufacturers, there is no eternal enemy, only eternal interests. On April 16th, after more than two years of fighting over patents, apple and qualcomm announced a formal settlement that will see the two companies drop dozens of patent cases against each other around the world. The price: apple paying qualcomm a hefty licensing fee, in the billions of dollars.

In its latest earnings report, qualcomm disclosed for the first time some details of the settlement with apple, such as a one-time payment of a large fee to qualcomm, a six-year licensing agreement between the two companies, and apple's agreement to purchase qualcomm chips. Qualcomm said it expects to receive $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in royalties from its settlement with apple.

For apple, and qualcomm cooperation is only temporary expediency, the future baseband self-developed road must go.

According to the latest reports, apple is working hard to develop its own chip technology, employing a number of Intel related technical experts, and has announced to set up an office area of 1200 employees in San Diego, the United States, to work on wireless engineering business, to design its own data chips within the company.


To speed up the development of data chips, apple last summer began talks with Intel to buy its data chip business for mobile phones.

Because of the iPhone's decline, the acquisition talks with Intel are primarily aimed at strengthening apple's core business rather than expanding into other areas, according to people familiar with the matter. People in the industry believe that buying Intel's smartphone data chip business will save apple a lot of research and development time.

Compared with huawei, qualcomm and samsung, baseband chips have become one of the biggest obstacles to apple's march into 5G. It has previously been reported that apple was interested in using samsung's 5G baseband chips, but samsung declined.

In a conference call after apple's second-quarter report, Mr Cook was asked about "what is apple's 5G strategy" and "when will it launch 5G products", saying 5G was not yet on apple's mind. He said apple would carefully evaluate new technologies and launch products as soon as possible, at the right time and under the right conditions.
