In its forecast for the industry over the next 20 years, the federal aviation administration said "nearly 15,000 [commercial drones] are being registered every month, almost three times the number registered for commercial drones in the same period last year". More than 27,000 commercial drones were registered as of the end of 2018, the FAA said. The FAA expects the commercial drone market to triple in size by 2023, when it expects 823,000 commercial drones to be in service.
