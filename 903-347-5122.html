In Japan, efforts have been made to move "flying cars", which move by vertical take-off and landing, into commercial service. Sumitomo will partner with Bell Helicopter Textron to bring "flying cars" to practical use by 2025, with the aim of first launching a pilot pilot of large unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) within this year and conducting an investigation into operational services. Although this is expected to stimulate relevant industries in Japan, there are still many problems to be solved, such as the development of flying cars and slow legislation.

The large uavs used for the verification test have a body width of about 2 meters and can fly for tens of kilometers. The Japanese government eased restrictions in September 2018 to allow drones to fly beyond line-of-sight in sparsely populated areas and other areas. In view of this, sumitomo and bell helicopters will begin work on the selection of local self-governing bodies that could become demonstration sites.



The American bell helicopter, developed in partnership with sumitomo, is a "flying car"

Sumitomo's bell helicopter is a large manufacturer of helicopters as well as military aircraft. High technology in vertical takeoff field. The company disclosed in January that it was developing the Nexus, a flying car for manned flights. It has five seats and a range of about 240 kilometers. Trials are under way to build aircraft that can operate autonomously with no one at all.


The partnership also includes the Nexus. In the Nexus space, sumitomo was the first Japanese company to partner with bell helicopter. The two companies aim to utilise the technology by 2025 to investigate the market for commercial services in areas such as logistics and tourism, while working together to advance negotiations on the administrative approvals needed to launch the services and to develop business models such as aircraft sales and maintenance. It is also looking to explore offering taxis through sumitomo's leasing arm.

Yamato holdings, a Japanese logistics company, also has logistics ideas for sumitomo's large piloted drones, scheduled for a demonstration flight in the us this summer. With regard to the use of drones for distribution services, Japan's rakuten is carrying out a pilot experiment to deliver daily necessities and packed lunches to houses on the shizuoka plain near the mountains, and plans to launch the earliest distribution service in Japan to sparsely populated areas by 2020.
