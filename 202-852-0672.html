Just entering may, market research firm IDC released its global smartphone market statistics report for the first quarter of 2019. According to the report, global smartphone shipments totaled 310.8 million units in the first quarter of 2019, down 6.6 percent from the same period last year (332.7 million units).

It is worth noting that in the first three months of 2019, smartphone shipments in the Chinese market were 73.072 million, also down 10.7 percent, according to data released by China information technology academy.

Clearly, the global smartphone market is still in a downward trend since the first decline began last year. And that means more competition in the stock market, making it harder for smartphone makers to keep growing.

Samsung led the way with 71.9 million smartphones shipped in the first quarter, down 8.1 percent from a year earlier, according to IDC. Huawei shipped 59.1 million smartphones in the first quarter, up 50.3 percent from a year earlier, thanks to growth in the Mate20 and glory and nova models. However, due to high pricing, lack of innovative selling points and functions, and competition from other Chinese handset manufacturers, apple's iPhone sales volume was not good, with only 36.4 million units shipped in the first quarter, a sharp drop of 30.2% compared with the same period last year. This also enabled huawei to successfully surpass apple in terms of shipments in the first quarter, ranking the second place.
