A metal manufacturer that supplied defective rocket parts to NASA has been sued after an investigation found it had falsified thousands of test results. The company caused damage to two satellites worth $700 million.

Hundreds of customers lost billions of dollars as sapa, an American aluminium extruder, falsified certificates that its aluminium had passed quality tests.

Jim Norman, head of NASA's launch services division, said: "the mission failed when the test results were changed and fake certificates were provided. Our trust has been severely undermined.

The report said the defective aluminum was used to make the Taurus XL rocket. The rocket launched NASA's orbiting carbon observatory in 2009 and the $424 million brilliant earth observatory in 2011. Both satellites were launched to collect climate science data by observing earth from space.

Years of scientific work were lost along with equipment that failed to open and detach the rocket's fairing, 
a clam shell designed to protect the satellite as it passed through the atmosphere. The rocket was too heavy to enter orbit 
and was later towed down, causing it to disintegrate and burn up.
