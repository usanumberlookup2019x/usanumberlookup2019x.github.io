The mobile chip market is harder to crack because global tech giants have established themselves and investors are reluctant to fund long-term research and development.

Take Mymo Wireless.

The bangalore - based company was hatched a decade ago from the india-bangalore institute of science with the goal of transforming India's microchip industry and becoming a challenger to us-based qualcomm.

The company initially gained expertise in chipmaking, focusing on making IP, licensing technology and making chips for other companies. This strategic decision helped it reap a steady 30 per cent profit.

It soon realised, however, that chip-making was an expensive proposition. When the company tried to raise $20 million a year ago, no venture capitalist wanted to invest. "Said co-founder Sondur Madhan Babu. "Indians lack the ability to take risks and invest a lot of money over a long period of time.

They want to see returns the next year. Soon after, it was acquired by an American technologist with a similar vision - to build the next qualcomm.

"I regret that we are no longer an Indian company, but as an entrepreneur I have to think about my business," Babu said. At least the vision is the same.

A similar dilemma faces Saankhya Labs, another successful start-up based in bangalore that has been working on chipsets for defence, satellite communications and broadcasting.

The company unveiled a new generation of on-chip system chip pruthvi-3, designed for mobile devices, radio, satellite and defense communications.

Saankhya is currently a technical partner of the Indian space research organization (isro), working on a project for Indian railways. It has installed chips on 1,000 locomotives that can track their location precisely, with delays of up to 30 seconds.

Still, India's chip market hasn't really taken off due to a lack of venture capital interest and money from hardware and product companies, said Parag Naik, co-founder and CEO.

"It's also not the kind of industry that can be built outside of university -- you need some industry experience and you have to work at it first," he says. It's a huge cognitive battle. We spend a lot of time fighting the idea that you can't build a technology company outside of India.

For example, according to Gartner, samsung electronics, the largest supplier of semiconductors, expanded its lead as the no. 1 supplier in 2018. The top 25 semiconductor suppliers saw their total revenue grow by 16.3 percent in 2018, accounting for 79.3 percent of the market share.
