Financial reform in southeast Asia driven by mobile payment
Undoubtedly, when the penetration rate of smart phones in southeast Asia exceeds 1/3, people start to pay various bills (35%), shopping (35%) and even plan travel (27%) more and more through mobile phones.

The change of consumers' consumption habits finally drives the mobile Internet transformation of the financial industry in southeast Asia.

According to incomplete statistics, the most popular e-wallets in southeast Asia include go-jek's go-pay, Indonesian telecom company Tcash, Indonesian financial giant Lippo's OVO, and ant financial's Dana.

The results showed that 70 percent of respondents in southeast Asia use banking services at least once a week via mobile devices, and 75 percent have at least one banking APP on their phones. In contrast, only 31% of respondents said they visited a physical bank at least once a week, compared with 12% in Singapore.

When it comes to the e-banking services that users use on the mobile terminal, the top three services are checking account balance and historical transaction records (38%), transfer service (33%) and bill payment service (30%). In Thailand, the country with the most popular e-banking services, the percentages were 51 percent, 51 percent and 41 percent, respectively.

It is worth mentioning that the new payment method, scanning code payment, is widely loved by merchants and users in southeast Asia due to its quick, easy-to-use and low-cost nature.

According to the survey results, more than 58 percent of southeast Asian respondents said they were aware of payment by scanning codes, and 28 percent of respondents were using this method of payment. In Thailand (42 per cent), Vietnam (35 per cent) and Indonesia (31 per cent), scanning has become the more popular method of payment.
