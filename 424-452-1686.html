For practitioners in every industry, access to key patents is the key to maintaining an upstream position, which can generate a steady stream of royalty income for patent holders. According to the latest research data from patent analysis firm IPlytics (published via the nikkei), China led the global list of 5G patent applications with 34% as of March 2019. It was followed by South Korea at 25 percent, the United States and Finland at 14 percent each. Sweden is close to 8 per cent, Japan is close to 5 per cent, while Taiwan, Canada, the UK and Italy each account for less than 1 per cent.

If the data is accurate, then Chinese companies' standard necessary patent application rate in the 5G market will be significantly higher than that in the 4G market. It also means that Chinese companies will still receive a third of global revenues from 5G patents, even if they are blocked in some countries.

IPlytics analyzed 94 million documents related to patents and standards rather than the final authorized patents, so its assessment is somewhat controversial. Through keyword searches, the agency identified sample pools containing about 74,500 key 5G patents.

Among the key 5G patents, the automobile industry takes the lead, while the patents of 5G Internet of things and smart energy have been rising slightly, while the proportion of smart factory patents has been small but stable.

Another interesting fact: China's share of 5G patents is better than its 50% share of the 4G market. In the 4G market, China, like South Korea, each holds about 22 per cent of the world's patents. While in the 5G market, other countries such as the United States and Japan have slowed down the pace of patent applications, while China has maintained an edge, with south Korean, Finnish and Swedish companies all seeing a slight increase in the percentage of patent applications.
